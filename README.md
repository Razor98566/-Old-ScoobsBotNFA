# Scoobs Bot NFA

Scoobs Bot NFA is a small Discord made in C# that is covering some features I wanted to have on my server.

I started this project mainly to get comfy with C# and get some nice features for my Discord.

Features included:

- Send a random word from a predefined list as a message with an included google search link (dumb copy paste, quality of results may vary)
  - The random word list can be customised under /Scoobs Bot NFA/Sources/words.txt
- Dice roll with specified amount of sides and dices
- Fully functional game of Hangman in the chat
- Help command
- weeb command (search for lewd 2d waifus, NSFW channel required)
- wedge and gbp points (just some dumb points system to show your appreciation for Scoobs!)
  - He may or may not try to get wedges from you when Kartoffelprodukte or wedges are mentioned
- Custom bot token
- Custom command key/prefix

How to run:
- Start the exe
- Enter the bot token
- Enter the command key/prefix
- Scoobs is now ready, zoinks!
