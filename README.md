# Scoobs Bot NFA

Scoobs Bot NFA is a small Discord made in C# that is covering some features I wanted to have on my server.

I started this project mainly to get comfy with C# and get some nice features for my Discord.

Features included:

- Send a random word from a predefined list as a message with an included wikipedia search link (dumb copy paste, not accurate all the time rn)
- Dice roll with specified amount of sides and dices
- Fully functional game of Hangman in the chat
- Help command
